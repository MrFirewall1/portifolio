        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me grow both personally and professionally. <br> 
        I love to fish, which gives me the opportunity to relax and reflect, teaching me patience and adaptability.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about attending IT-related events. These events keep me updated with the latest technologies and provide a platform to meet like-minded people. Networking is something I value highly, as I believe collaboration and knowledge-sharing lead to personal growth and new opportunities.</p>
        <p>Meeting new people and building networks is important to me. It's through these interactions that I gain new insights and get inspired to push myself further. I always strive to learn something new and to develop my skills, whether through work, study, or conversations with others.</p>
